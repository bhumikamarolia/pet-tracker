# Pet Tracker - Spring Boot API

A simple Spring Boot application for tracking pets (Dogs and Cats) with in-zone detection and grouped reporting. Designed as part of a backend task using Java 11, Spring Boot, JPA, and an in-memory H2 database.

## Features

- REST API to add and track Dogs and Cats  
- Single Table Inheritance using `@Inheritance`  
- Validation: Cat must have `lostTracker` field  
- Endpoint to get pets that are out of zone, grouped by type and tracker  
- H2 in-memory database â€” no setup needed  
- Unit tests for service and controller layers

## Technologies Used

- Java 11  
- Spring Boot 2.7.15  
- Spring Data JPA  
- H2 Database  
- Maven Wrapper (mvnd)  
- JUnit 5 + Mockito  
- MockMvc for controller tests
